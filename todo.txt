TODO
 - GUI
   - Display what robot's plans are
 - Communication
   - RobotManager should tell Robot what job it has regularly
   - Needs function in BTServer - sendRobotInfo(Robot r);
   - Distance needs to be properly handled by the BTServer - call distanceRecieved on MainInterface
   - Distance needs to be only transmitted at each junction
 - Localisation
   - Robot should tell the server when it doesn't know where it is: via the ESCAPE button when unloading/picking up
   - Server then should stop all robots, then start localisation.
   - GUI should then display probable locations of robot (Extension)
